Special Arithematic
	-Compute powers of numbers using the ** operator. (a ** b)
	-Floor division is the result of the // operator. (a // b)
	-Rounding a floating point number uses the round(num, place) method.
	-Support for int, float, Decimal, and Fraction.

Strings
	-Strings can be encloses in single or double quotes.
	-Use \ to escape the type of quotes we are currently in.
	-Use a raw string by placing an r before it. This ignores \ as a 
	 special character.
	-Strings can be contained by triple quotes and will be printed exactly as
	 they appear in the code including white space and new lines.
	-Repeat strings using the * operator and an integer value.
	-Concatenate strings with the + operator.
	-Strings placed directly after one another in seperate pairs of quotes will
	 automatically be concatenated with one another. This is useful when we 
	 want to break a long string into multiple lines. If we place the strings in 
	 parentheses it is then unecessary to use the + operator on each line.
	-Index strings using the word[index] with the first letter appearing at 
	 index 0. Negative indicies can also be used with the last letter at index
	 -1.
	-Slicing is also supported. Use word[beg:end] to obtain a substring of the 
	 original string. The first index of the substring is inclusive while the 
	 last index is exclusive. i.e. "word"[1:3] results is "or"
	-When slicing, leaving the beginning index blank results in the first 
	 index, and leaving the end index blank results in the last index.
	-If we use an index that is too large we get an error, but when slicing an
	 index too large or small, it will be corrected or return empty.
	-Strings are immutable and trying to change the value of a specific index is
	 not allowed. If we need to change a string we have to create a new one.
	-To get the length of a string we can use the len(string) method
