   Programming

Programming language vs framework:
	A language is syntax, grammar, semantics (and perhaps a core library) that 
	implementers are required to support. A framework is a cohesive set of 
	library code that together simplifies programming in any given language.

InterfaceName obj = new ImplClassName();:
	- ex. List myList = new ArrayList<>();
	This forces us to program to the interface, which is a good thing. If we
	decide later that an array list was not the best implementation for our 
	current program, we only need to change the code at this line because we
	can be confident that code only contains methods that are known to the 
	interface.
